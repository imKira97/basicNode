Event loop  is a loop which is run and started by nodejs that keeps the node js process running 
It handles callback function and it has certain order in which it goes through the callbacks


At each iteration-
i) Timers- check for timer callback 
ii) check for other I/O related callbacks (File or Network ) this callback may take a long time to finish 
If it takes long time nodejs will go in next phase and postpone callbacks of this phase till next iteration
iii) after working on these open callback it will enter in Poll phase here it looks for new I/O events  and do it best to execute 
their callback immediately
iv)If poll phase callback could not able to execute than this callback registered as pending callback
It also check for timer cb due to be executed and it will jump to timer phase to execute them right away.

v)check phase- next all setImmediate callback will be execute in this phase they are like setTimeout and setInterval
vi)at end of each iteration cycle node js will execute all close event callbacks
vii) we might exit the whole program only if there is no remaining callback or eventlistener which are register to execute
node js keeps track of this as a counter(reference or refes)
